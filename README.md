## Objective：
   To achieve a set of small white can easily use high-performance, can meet most scenarios of the server engine framework, the underlying components are written by cpp, business support cpp, lua, pyton and other languages development, bnet as the framework of the network library.

## Features：

1. High code reusability reduces the complexity of writing code generation tools for the server engine framework (provided later).
2. Support tcp, tcps, udp, kcp, websocket, websockets, http, https and other protocols.
3. High performance, simple interface, easy to use.
4. Based on c++20 coroutines, asynchronous logic is realized.
5. For details, see test/proxy.hpp.

## Use：

	Include the bnet.hpp header file to use.

Detailed documentation will be updated and new features and related code optimizations will be integrated on an ongoing basis.
